# Hello!

I am a PhD student in the Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics at Duke University. Prior to Duke, I received my MS in Statistics at the University of Washington and BEng in Industrial Engineering at Tsinghua University.

My primary research interest lies in the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials (CRTs). I am also interested in integrating CRTs with other fields, including causal inference and survival analysis, to improve current methods in CRT research. I am particularly motivated by the applied areas that significantly affect marginalized communities and the least developed countries, such as HIV, social stigma, and child mortality.
